Ok. I have made some changes in my inquiries table. Following is the new structure:

-- INQUIRIES
CREATE TABLE inquiries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    
    -- RELATIONSHIPS
    buyer_id UUID REFERENCES buyers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    vendor_id UUID REFERENCES vendors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    
    -- BUYER STATE (ACID writes, BASE reads)
    buyer_inquiry JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB,
    
    -- VENDOR STATE (BASE writes, ACID reads)
    vendor_response JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB,

	summary TEXT,
	
    -- STATUS
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL CHECK (status IN (
        'submitted',       -- Sent to vendor but vendor not yet responded back
        'responded',       -- Vendor responded, buyer can see but buyer not yet responded back
        'accepted',        -- Deal done
        'rejected'         -- Deal lost
    )),
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

As you can see I have added a new column called summary, this column stores summary of inquiry state, whenever inquiry status is changed due to change in either (either of json), the ai agents should first retrieve the full inquiry state (buyer inquiry json, vendor response json, exisiting summary) and the new change (either of the json that is being changed) and summarize everthing and update the summary. In simple terms this column keeps a summary of all the negotiations happened till last change. 

For the status column, I have removed draft, and pending review, because, the anyhow, we want ai agent to confirm with the user before making any change in the inquiry or response hence there is no need of draft. And pending review is same as submitted. so it was redundant. 

I updated MCP inquiry tools and the relevant prompts accordingly and now I want you to update the backend and frontend accordingly
